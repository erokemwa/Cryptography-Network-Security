# Cryptography-Network_Security
Every secret creates a potential failure point

The goal for the course project is for you to apply concepts and techniques for ensuring confi- dentiality and integrity of data transmitted between two interconnected parties. This should solidify your understanding of the nature and implementation issues of security protocols and help you in realizing the importance of cryptography in secure communications.

Ob jective
Your objective is to build a secure communication protocol between two programs: a client and a server. These two programs will be communicating using the TCP/IP protocol and need to have their data be secured using authenticated encryption.
